This is custom code that I augmented for my needs.  I modified it to
easily demonstrate vulns and Checkmarx's ability to find dataflow issues.  I am going to use service hooks integration
through the 'Import project' feature of Checkmarx One.
there are a few vulnerabilities from SQLi to XSS (all basic), but used for displaying how the product works from finding to fixing, including pushing results to something like Jira, so developers can consume the results easily.
